In order to run the predictions code, please install SLEAP and run inference using a trained model. Then, update the code to correctly refer to the predictions file, the video used for inference and the output source. Once this is done, run `main.py` to generate the predictions and view them.

Please feel free to email me if you want the dataset used for testing this code.
